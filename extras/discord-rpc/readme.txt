Incase you don't know how Discord RPC works...
These assets are just for what is on the Discord RPC Application itself.
I literally didn't even have to leave this here but I just will because I can't be bothered to leave it somewhere else on my PC.
The images will only change on Discord if you modify them via [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), but you also have to change the Application ID to the id your application has in `source/addons/DiscordRPC.hx`.

Some things you should note is:
- Minimum Size is REQUIRED to be 512 x 512 pixels and 1024 x 1024 pixels is the recommended size
- Supports .png .jpg or .jpeg
- logo = Logo | icon- = Icon
